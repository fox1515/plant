"Internship presented by Edunet Foundation, in collaboration with AICTE & Shell"

I am working on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning model as part of my internship, focusing on precision agriculture. The project aims to detect and classify plant diseases from high-resolution images of crop leaves, including apples, cherries, grapes, and corn. 

The model is being designed to accurately distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves while predicting specific types of diseases. My ongoing responsibilities include: 
- Collecting and preprocessing a diverse dataset of leaf images. 
- Designing, training, and optimizing the CNN architecture to achieve high accuracy and robustness. 
- Applying techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to improve model performance. 
- Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability. 
- Exploring deployment strategies for real-time predictions to facilitate early disease detection and effective management. 
- Deploy the project on GitHub and using Streamlit.

This experience is allowing me to enhance my expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and agricultural technology, demonstrating my ability to tackle real-world challenges with innovative machine learning solutions.
